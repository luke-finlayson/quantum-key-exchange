# Quantum Key Exchange

A simple transmitter and receiver that establish a secret key using an emulation of Quantum Key Exchange.
Subsequent messages can be sent once the key is established by using that key to encode and decode messages
with an XOR cipher.

## Usage

This project was created as a proof of concept - and while all the required functionality does exist, it is only being run via the unit tests. 
However, it would be simple enough to run the components as a complete system. 

_Documentation TBA._
